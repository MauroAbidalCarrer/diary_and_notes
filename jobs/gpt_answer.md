## Experience

**Child-Mind-Institute-2025 Kaggle Competition**  
- Ranked **146th out of 2600 participants** with an **0.831 F1 score** as a solo competitor.  
- Designed a custom solution that outperformed the best public notebook baselines.  
- Implemented data preprocessing with **pandas, numpy, sklearn**.  
- Parallelized cross-validation training across multiple GPUs with **PyTorch multiprocessing**, achieving up to **10x speedup** when scaling to 10 GPUs.  
- Applied hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** integrated with the parallelized training framework.  
- Self-directed research and solution design, demonstrating strong independence and initiative.  
- Learned and applied advanced PyTorch concepts (e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt architectures; FreeAT augmentation).  
- Built a toy CNN library from scratch in **NumPy** to learn the fundamentals of CV architectures.

**Data Science Intern – BIB Batteries (1 year)**  
- Developed an end-to-end pipeline for **EV battery State of Health (SoH) prediction** using real-world data from **14k+ monitored vehicles (13k Teslas)**.  
- Designed a **multi-step ETL + ML pipeline** (bronze/silver/gold stages) using **pandas, sklearn, PostgreSQL, S3**:  
  - Converted raw per-manufacturer JSON → parquet files.  
  - Preprocessed time-series data (charging states, speed, current properties, temperature, etc.).  
  - Estimated SoH with a novel approach validated against physical tests (**1% MAE**).  
  - Aggregated fleet-level data to provide business insights (e.g., SoH degradation per mileage, resale value predictions).  
- Delivered a **production-ready pipeline** optimized for limited resources (“on-budget” machines).  
- Maintained reproducible workflows with clean, versioned notebooks.  
- Operated in a fast-paced startup, working independently while integrating supervisor feedback (meetings every ~2 days).  
- Gained experience in **researching undocumented approaches**, putting them into production, and balancing multiple deadlines.

**Motor Imagery Classification Project – University**  
- Built an **EEG signal classification pipeline** using **MNE, numpy, sklearn**:  
  - Applied bandpass filtering.  
  - Implemented **Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)** from scratch.  
  - Applied **Lasso classification**.  
- Learned core ML/DL concepts and underlying math (e.g., CSP theory).  

---

**Open Source Contribution – Open Code Interpreter (GitHub)**  
- Added functionality to serialize user messages, assistant messages, code, and code outputs into a single notebook file.  

---

**Independent Learning & Projects**  
- Completed **Neural Networks from Scratch** (book), implementing concepts in practice.  
- Developed multiple toy projects and experiments to deepen ML knowledge.  

---

**Freelance Game Developer (Unity, 6 months)**  
- Delivered game mechanics and prototypes to clients using **Unity & C#**.  

---

**Game Jam – VivaTech (Team Project, 2 days)**  
- Won a team game jam organized by **VivaTech**.  
- The winning game was showcased at the VivaTech event.  
- Experience working under tight deadlines with collaborative teamwork.

**École 42 – Main Curriculum Projects**  
- **webserv**: Implemented an Nginx-like web server in C++.  
- **MiniRT**: Built a basic ray-tracing engine.  
- **FDF**: Rendered wireframe meshes with orthographic and perspective projections.  
- **minishell**: Reimplemented a bash-like shell in C.  
- Acquired strong **low-level systems knowledge**: processes, parent/child relationships, signals, pipes, sockets, and OS fundamentals.  
- Developed a reputation for **rigorous, production-quality code**.

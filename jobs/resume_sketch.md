### Skills:
  - Programming languages: Python, C, C#
  - Programming Frameworks: PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Optuna, scikit-learn
  - Spoken Languages: English, French, Italian

### Experience and projects:

- **Child-Mind-Institute-2025 Kaggle Competition**  
    - reached **146th place out of 2600** participants with an **0.83 F1 score** as a **solo competitor**.  
        -   Data preprocessing using pandas, numpy and sklearn.
        -   Cross validation training parallelized over mutliple GPUs using pytorch's multiprocessing module.
        -   Hyper parameter tuning using Optuna and the afford mentioned training solution.

- **BIB Batteries – Data Science Intern (1 year)**  
    - Learned to write clear and reproduceable notebooks.
    - Predicted **State of Health (SoH)** of EV batteries using real-world fleet data (~14k vehicles, mostly Teslas).  
        - Designed a **4-stage pandas + sklearn pipeline**: JSON ingestion → preprocessing & segmentation → SoH estimation (1% MAE vs. physical tests) → business insights.  
        - Cached intermediate data (bronze/silver/gold layers) as parquet files in S3.  
        - Stored results in PostgreSQL and derived insights such as **per-model SoH degradation per mileage**, supporting second-hand EV valuation.  

- **Freelance Game Developer (6 months)**  
    - Delivered small game projects for clients.  
    - Worked across gameplay programming, prototyping, and asset integration.  

- **École 42 – Main Cursus**  
    - Completed intensive, project-based software engineering program.  
        - **Won Vivatech game jam**, with project showcased at the event.  
        - **webserv**: Nginx-like web server in C++.  
        - **MiniRT**: Basic ray tracing engine.  
        - **FDF**: Mesh rendering in orthographic & perspective projections.  
        - **minishell**: Bash reimplementation in C.  

-  **Motor imagery classification task from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.**
    -  Used MNE library to preprocess the data from 
    -  Learned the statistical concepts behind dimensionality reduction algorithm "Common Spatial Pattern" (CSP).
    -  Implemented a cross validation training pipeline and then a 
    -  Modified the pipeline to perform inference in real time.
    -  Library used: MNE, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

- **Computer Vision Learning Projects**  
    - Implemented CNN architectures (ResNet, FreeAT augmentations).  
    - Built a toy CNN library from scratch using NumPy.  

- **Open Source Contribution – "open-code-interpreter"**  
    - Added feature to **serialize conversation, code, and outputs** into a single notebook file.  

- **Personal Learning**  
    - Completed *Neural Networks from Scratch* book for fundamentals in deep learning.

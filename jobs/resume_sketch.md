### Skills:
  - Programming languages: Python, C, C#  
  - Programming Frameworks: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Optuna, scikit-learn  
  - Spoken Languages: English, French, Italian  

### Experience and projects:

- **Child-Mind-Institute-2025 Kaggle Competition**  
    - Reached **146th place out of 2600** participants with an **0.83 F1 score** as a **solo competitor**.  
    - Data preprocessing using Pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn.  
    - Cross-validation training parallelized over multiple GPUs using PyTorch's multiprocessing module.  
      The parallelization enabled scaling/speedup up to 10x.  
    - Hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** and the aforementioned training solution.  
    - **Independently researched Multi-Task Learning** and implemented it to better leverage the dataset.  
    - This in part enabled me to outperform the best public notebook of the competition with a 0.81 F1 score.  

- **BIB Batteries – Data Science Intern (1 year)**  
    - Predicted **State of Health (SoH)** of EV batteries using real-world fleet data (+14k vehicles, mostly Teslas).  
    - Learned to write clear and reproducible notebooks.
    - Worked in a startup fast paced environment where I learned to deal with quickly changing goals and deadlines.
    - Worked in an agile environment.
    - Mastered Git.
    - Designed, delivered to **production**, and maintained a **medallion architecture ETL+ML pipeline**:  
        - Converted raw per-manufacturer JSON to Parquet files.  
        - Preprocessed vehicle time-series (charging states, speed, current properties, temperature, etc.).  
        - Estimated SoH with a novel approach later validated against physical tests with **1% MAE** (SoH is estimated in percentage).  
        - Aggregated fleet-level data to provide business insights, e.g.:  
            - SoH degradation per mileage per model  
            - Principal influential factors of SoH loss  
            - Resale value predictions  
    - Stored intermediate data as Parquet files in an **S3 bucket** and business insights into a **PostgreSQL** database.  

- **Personal Projects**  
    - Implemented more CV concepts (ResNet, FreeAT augmentations) using PyTorch.  
    - Built a toy CNN library from scratch using NumPy.  
    - Completed *Neural Networks from Scratch* book for fundamentals in deep learning.
    - Contributed to open source project [local code interpreter](https://github.com/MrGreyfun/Local-Code-Interpreter)

- **Freelance Unity Game Developer (6 months)**  
    - Delivered small game projects for clients.  
    - Worked across gameplay programming, prototyping, and asset integration.  

- **School 42 – Data Science Branch**  
    - Motor imagery classification task from (EEG) recordings (i.e., recognizing movements from brain waves).  
        - Used MNE library to preprocess data, apply bandpass filtering, and segment experiments.  
        - Learned the statistical concepts behind dimensionality reduction algorithm **Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)**.  
        - Implemented a cross-validation training pipeline.  
        - Modified the pipeline to perform **real-time inference**.  

- **School 42 – Main Cursus**  
    - Learned low-level software engineering concepts through a project-based program.  
      Note: Not all the projects are mentioned here.  
        - **Won VivaTech game jam**, with project showcased at VivaTech.  
        - **webserv**: Nginx-like web server in C++.  
        - **minishell**: Bash reimplementation in C.  
        - **philosophers**: Solved dining philosophers problem in multithreading.  
        - **MiniRT**: Basic ray tracing engine.  
        - **FDF**: Mesh rendering in orthographic & perspective projections.

###theoretical/fundamentals concepts: 20th of May to 1st of June and 11th of June to 20th of June (~20 days)
*Learn pytorch, the theory and hopefully work on top on a recent paper and make a new one(maybe just a blog?).*
Goals:
    - Be able to train a (SOTA?) model on a common task (CV, NLP, whatever).
    - Be able to explain:
        - WHY I used the given hyper parameters + architecture.
        - WHY the model works 
Tasks:
- read VGG + resnet papers (done)
- read resnet paper (done)
- read learning rate finder (done)
- read one cycle policy blog post (done)
- Reimplement 90% on CIFAR10 (done)
- good model on imagenet ?
- YOLO ?
- Transformer ?
- Gen image model ?
- read blog/paper/watch video on adversirial attacks(done, kind of...)
- Read Neural nets always grokk and here is why (done)
- (re)Read building block of interpretability blog ?
- Use adv attacks as better local complexity ?
- Read circuit theory ?
- Read spline theory ?
- Read spline cam ?

###Practical work: 20th of June to 20th Jully (30 days)
*Do some work on a practical task*
- (kaggle?)
    - Use transfer learning
- Reinforcement learning
    - chess?
    - sc2?
    - huggin face's lerobot?
